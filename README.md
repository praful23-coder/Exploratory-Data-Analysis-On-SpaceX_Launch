# <span style="color: #1E90FF;">SpaceX Launch Data Analysis</span>

## <span style="color: #32CD32;">Overview</span>

This repository contains an analysis of SpaceX launches, focusing on key metrics such as mission success rates, landing performance, booster versions, launch sites, payload mass, and time trends. The analysis aims to provide insights into SpaceX's operational efficiency and growth over the years, using historical launch data.

## <span style="color: #FFD700;">Key Findings</span>

### 1. <span style="color: #FF6347;">Mission Success Rate</span>  
- SpaceX boasts an impressive **94.4% mission success rate**.
- Early launches had a higher failure rate (**5.4%**), but the company has since improved its technology and operations.

### 2. <span style="color: #FF6347;">Landing Success Rate</span>  
- Landing success rates have varied but overall improved with newer missions.
- The most successful landings occurred on **drone ships** and **ground pads**.

### 3. <span style="color: #FF6347;">Booster Versions</span>  
- The **F9 v1.1** booster version is the most commonly used and has demonstrated good consistency in both mission and landing success.

### 4. <span style="color: #FF6347;">Launch Sites</span>  
- The most active launch site is **CCAFS SLC 40**, followed by **KSC LC 39A**, indicating a strong reliance on Florida-based facilities for operations.

### 5. <span style="color: #FF6347;">Payload Mass</span>  
- While payload mass varies, thereâ€™s no direct correlation between heavier payloads and mission failures, suggesting SpaceX's ability to handle diverse mission profiles efficiently.

### 6. <span style="color: #FF6347;">Time Trends</span>  
- Mission and landing success rates have shown steady improvement year over year.
- However, there was a brief dip in success between **2014 and 2015**.

## <span style="color: #FFD700;">Project Files</span>

- **Data Analysis Scripts**: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Launch Data**: A dataset containing information on all SpaceX missions (date, success, payload, landing, etc.).
- **Graphs & Visualizations**: Charts and graphs illustrating trends, such as mission success over time, landing success rates, and payload mass distribution.
